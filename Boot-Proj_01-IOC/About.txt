Spring starter projects are the advanced type of projects used to develope SpringBoot applications
with some predefined project structure and a set of starter which are capable of performing auto configuration.

Eg. Spring context support starter is bydefault comming with every basic SB project and it arranges
number of main jars, dependent and relevent jars in to the project. Which are having some predefined
classes and IOC container takes the jars and created objects of those classes.

Required Annotations:
	1) @SpringBootApplication
		Internally it contains @Configuration, @ComponentScan and @EnableAutoConfiguration. So we can
		use it with our class containing main() as configuration file.
		
		we can place predefined class object creation method(the classes not related to SB starter
		pack we	added while creating the project) with @Bean.
	
	2) @Component or @Service or @Controler etc like Sterio type annotations for defining userdefined class.
		
	3) @Autowired for field injection.
