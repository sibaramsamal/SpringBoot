The prime focus of using Strategy DP is to achieve loose coupling between the classes.
The 3 key rules to achieve this are;
	1) Always prefer composition over inheritance
	2) Always try to code to interfaces.
	3) Our code should be open for enhancements but must be close for modifications.

In this example, we have implemented the courior type classes in order to achieve less dependency between these classes.
