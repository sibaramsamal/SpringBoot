The main task of this DP approach is to achieve the abstraction on the object creataion.
- Here we just need to call the static method of factory class and that method is responsible for creation of the required object we have passed as argument.
- In this example, BudgetCar, Luxury car and the sports car are the types of Car varients. And MRF, CEAT are the varient of Tyre class.
	By help of this DP, we can get the object of SportsCar, LuxuryCar, BudgetCar etc and passed Different tyre object. Bases on the tyre type, it will return object.
- To achieve loose coupling, we have implemented Car and Tyre interfaces and created their respective concrete classes.
- CarFactory is our factory class here containing getCarInstance() to return Car object based n the tyer type.
