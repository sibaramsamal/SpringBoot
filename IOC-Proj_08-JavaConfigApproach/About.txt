In 100% code or java config approach, we can have normal java project or maven or gradle one.
Here all the object creation instructionns are fetched from the configuration class.

For userdefined classes, the classes mentioned with sterio type annotation are fetched from the mensioned "basePackages"
attribute of @ComponentScan() annotation.

For predefined classes, user have to manually create object creation logics inside @Bean annotated method.
And place that method inside our configuration class.

Java configuration class is a replacement of xml file and annotated with @Configuration 

Here all the required jars are to be arranged by programmer manually.

@Autowired annotation is used with the fields inside the classes and based on the annotations,
the IOC container created beans are injected directly to the fields.
