Properties files are the external files usually a normal text files having "key = value" pair 
data in it.

To work with properties file in the java config approach, we have to follow these conditions.
	1) Create a properties file (application.properties in this case)
	2) create a xml file to set a context value for the container and provide an alias for that key
		- Here context type schema must be added to use <context> inside which property-placeholder attribute
		needed to locate the properties file
		
		- <alias> tag is used to give an alias name to our key that is mensioned inside properties file
	3)  Now we have to link the xml file with our configuration class using 
			@ImportResource()
	
	4) Now to use the alias in the target class we have to place the alias name in 
		@Qualifier("aliasname") with the field which we want to get the injected data
